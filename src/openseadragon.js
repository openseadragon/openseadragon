 /**
  * All required and optional settings for instantiating a new instance of an OpenSeadragon image viewer.
  *
  * @typedef {Object} Options
  * @memberof OpenSeadragon
  *
  * @property {String} id
  *     Id of the element to append the viewer's container element to. If not provided, the 'element' property must be provided.
  *     If both the element and id properties are specified, the viewer is appended to the element provided in the element property.
  *
  * @property {Element} element
  *     The element to append the viewer's container element to. If not provided, the 'id' property must be provided.
  *     If both the element and id properties are specified, the viewer is appended to the element provided in the element property.
  *
  * @property {Array|String|Function|Object[]|Array[]|String[]|Function[]} [tileSources=null]
  *     As an Array, the tileSource can hold either Objects or mixed
  *     types of Arrays of Objects, Strings, or Functions. When a value is a String,
  *     the tileSource is used to create a {@link OpenSeadragon.DziTileSource}.
  *     When a value is a Function, the function is used to create a new
  *     {@link OpenSeadragon.TileSource} whose abstract method
  *     getUrl( level, x, y ) is implemented by the function. Finally, when it
  *     is an Array of objects, it is used to create a
  *     {@link OpenSeadragon.LegacyTileSource}.
  *
  * @property {Array} overlays Array of objects defining permanent overlays of
  *     the viewer. The overlays added via this option and later removed with
  *     {@link OpenSeadragon.Viewer#removeOverlay} will be added back when a new
  *     image is opened.
  *     To add overlays which can be definitively removed, one must use
  *     {@link OpenSeadragon.Viewer#addOverlay}
  *     If displaying a sequence of images, the overlays can be associated
  *     with a specific page by passing the overlays array to the page's
  *     tile source configuration.
  *     Expected properties:
  *     * x, y, (or px, py for pixel coordinates) to define the location.
  *     * width, height in point if using x,y or in pixels if using px,py. If width
  *       and height are specified, the overlay size is adjusted when zooming,
  *       otherwise the size stays the size of the content (or the size defined by CSS).
  *     * className to associate a class to the overlay
  *     * id to set the overlay element. If an element with this id already exists,
  *       it is reused, otherwise it is created. If not specified, a new element is
  *       created.
  *     * placement a string to define the relative position to the viewport.
  *       Only used if no width and height are specified. Default: 'TOP_LEFT'.
  *       See {@link OpenSeadragon.OverlayPlacement} for possible values.
  *
  * @property {String} [xmlPath=null]
  *     <strong>DEPRECATED</strong>. A relative path to load a DZI file from the server.
  *     Prefer the newer Options.tileSources.
  *
  * @property {String} [prefixUrl='/images/']
  *     Prepends the prefixUrl to navImages paths, which is very useful
  *     since the default paths are rarely useful for production
  *     environments.
  *
  * @property {OpenSeadragon.NavImages} [navImages]
  *     An object with a property for each button or other built-in navigation
  *     control, eg the current 'zoomIn', 'zoomOut', 'home', and 'fullpage'.
  *     Each of those in turn provides an image path for each state of the button
  *     or navigation control, eg 'REST', 'GROUP', 'HOVER', 'PRESS'. Finally the
  *     image paths, by default assume there is a folder on the servers root path
  *     called '/images', eg '/images/zoomin_rest.png'.  If you need to adjust
  *     these paths, prefer setting the option.prefixUrl rather than overriding
  *     every image path directly through this setting.
  *
  * @property {Object} [tileHost=null]
  *     TODO: Implement this. Currently not used.
  *
  * @property {Boolean} [debugMode=false]
  *     TODO: provide an in-screen panel providing event detail feedback.
  *
  * @property {String} [debugGridColor='#437AB2']
  *
  * @property {Number} [blendTime=0]
  *     Specifies the duration of animation as higher or lower level tiles are
  *     replacing the existing tile.
  *
  * @property {Boolean} [alwaysBlend=false]
  *     Forces the tile to always blend.  By default the tiles skip blending
  *     when the blendTime is surpassed and the current animation frame would
  *     not complete the blend.
  *
  * @property {Boolean} [autoHideControls=true]
  *     If the user stops interacting with the viewport, fade the navigation
  *     controls.  Useful for presentation since the controls are by default
  *     floated on top of the image the user is viewing.
  *
  * @property {Boolean} [immediateRender=false]
  *     Render the best closest level first, ignoring the lowering levels which
  *     provide the effect of very blurry to sharp. It is recommended to change
  *     setting to true for mobile devices.
  *
  * @property {Number} [defaultZoomLevel=0]
  *     Zoom level to use when image is first opened or the home button is clicked.
  *     If 0, adjusts to fit viewer.
  *
  * @property {Number} [opacity=1]
  *     Opacity of the drawer (1=opaque, 0=transparent)
  *
  * @property {Number} [layersAspectRatioEpsilon=0.0001]
  *     Maximum aspectRatio mismatch between 2 layers.
  *
  * @property {Number} [degrees=0]
  *     Initial rotation.
  *
  * @property {Number} [minZoomLevel=null]
  *
  * @property {Number} [maxZoomLevel=null]
  *
  * @property {Boolean} [panHorizontal=true]
  *     Allow horizontal pan.
  *
  * @property {Boolean} [panVertical=true]
  *     Allow vertical pan.
  *
  * @property {Boolean} [constrainDuringPan=false]
  *
  * @property {Boolean} [wrapHorizontal=false]
  *     Set to true to force the image to wrap horizontally within the viewport.
  *     Useful for maps or images representing the surface of a sphere or cylinder.
  *
  * @property {Boolean} [wrapVertical=false]
  *     Set to true to force the image to wrap vertically within the viewport.
  *     Useful for maps or images representing the surface of a sphere or cylinder.
  *
  * @property {Number} [minZoomImageRatio=0.9]
  *     The minimum percentage ( expressed as a number between 0 and 1 ) of
  *     the viewport height or width at which the zoom out will be constrained.
  *     Setting it to 0, for example will allow you to zoom out infinitly.
  *
  * @property {Number} [maxZoomPixelRatio=1.1]
  *     The maximum ratio to allow a zoom-in to affect the highest level pixel
  *     ratio. This can be set to Infinity to allow 'infinite' zooming into the
  *     image though it is less effective visually if the HTML5 Canvas is not
  *     availble on the viewing device.
  *
  * @property {Boolean} [autoResize=true]
  *     Set to false to prevent polling for viewer size changes. Useful for providing custom resize behavior.
  *
  * @property {Number} [pixelsPerWheelLine=40]
  *     For pixel-resolution scrolling devices, the number of pixels equal to one scroll line.
  *
  * @property {Number} [visibilityRatio=0.5]
  *     The percentage ( as a number from 0 to 1 ) of the source image which
  *     must be kept within the viewport.  If the image is dragged beyond that
  *     limit, it will 'bounce' back until the minimum visibility ration is
  *     achieved.  Setting this to 0 and wrapHorizontal ( or wrapVertical ) to
  *     true will provide the effect of an infinitely scrolling viewport.
  *
  * @property {Number} [imageLoaderLimit=0]
  *     The maximum number of image requests to make concurrently.  By default
  *     it is set to 0 allowing the browser to make the maximum number of
  *     image requests in parallel as allowed by the browsers policy.
  *
  * @property {Number} [clickTimeThreshold=300]
  *      The number of milliseconds within which a pointer down-up event combination
  *      will be treated as a click gesture.
  *

  *      to be treated as a click gesture.
  *
  * @property {Number} [dblClickTimeThreshold=300]
  *      The number of milliseconds within which two pointer down-up event combinations
  *      will be treated as a double-click gesture.
  *
  * @property {Number} [dblClickDistThreshold=20]
  *      The maximum distance allowed between two pointer click events
  *      to be treated as a double-click gesture.
  *
  * @property {Number} [springStiffness=6.5]
  *
  * @property {Number} [animationTime=1.2]

  *     The ID of a div to hold the navigator minimap.
  *     If an ID is specified, the navigatorPosition, navigatorSizeRatio, navigatorMaintainSizeRatio, and navigatorTop|Left|Height|Width options will be ignored.
  *     If an ID is not specified, a div element will be generated and placed on top of the main image.
  *
  * @property {String} [navigatorPosition='TOP_RIGHT']
  *     Valid values are 'TOP_LEFT', 'TOP_RIGHT', 'BOTTOM_LEFT', 'BOTTOM_RIGHT', or 'ABSOLUTE'.<br>
  *     If 'ABSOLUTE' is specified, then navigatorTop|Left|Height|Width determines the size and position of the navigator minimap in the viewer, and navigatorSizeRatio and navigatorMaintainSizeRatio are ignored.<br>

  *     try setting this to 1.5 or higher.
  *
  * @property {Boolean} [mouseNavEnabled=true]
  *     Is the user able to interact with the image via mouse or touch. Default
  *     interactions include draging the image in a plane, and zooming in toward

  *
  * @property {Boolean} [showNavigationControl=true]
  *     Set to false to prevent the appearance of the default navigation controls.<br>
  *     Note that if set to false, the customs buttons set by the options
  *     zoomInButton, zoomOutButton etc, are rendered inactive.
  *
  * @property {OpenSeadragon.ControlAnchor} [navigationControlAnchor=TOP_LEFT]
  *     Placement of the default navigation controls.
  *     To set the placement of the sequence controls, see the

  *     Note: {@link OpenSeadragon.Options.showNavigationControl} is overriding
  *     this setting when set to false.
  *
  * @property {Boolean} [showRotationControl=false]
  *     If true then the rotate left/right controls will be displayed as part of the
  *     standard controls. This is also subject to the browser support for rotate
  *     (e.g. viewer.drawer.canRotate()).<br>
  *     Note: {@link OpenSeadragon.Options.showNavigationControl} is overriding
  *     this setting when set to false.
