⚠️  AUTOMATED TESTS NOT YET WORKING
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The Puppeteer-based automated test runner has timing issues
and reports false failures. Please test manually instead:

1. Start the development server:
   ${'\x1b[36m'}bun run dev${'\x1b[0m'}

2. Open in your browser:
   ${'\x1b[36m'}http://localhost:8000/test/test.html${'\x1b[0m'}

3. Watch tests run (should see ~312 passing, 1 failing)

The 1 failure is expected on macOS due to fullscreen API behavior.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Would you like to:
  • Run automated anyway? ${'\x1b[33m'}bun run test:auto${'\x1b[0m'}
  • Start dev server? ${'\x1b[32m'}bun run dev${'\x1b[0m'}

See TESTING_GUIDE.md for more information.
