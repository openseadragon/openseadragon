OPENSEADRAGON CHANGELOG
=======================

6.0.0: (in progress...)

* NEW BEHAVIOR: OpenSeadragon Data Pipeline Overhaul (#2407, #2643 @Aiosa)
    * DEPRECATION: Properties on tile that manage drawer data, or store data to draw: Tile.[element|imgElement|style|context2D|getImage|getCanvasContext] and transitively Tile.getScaleForEdgeSmoothing
    * DEPRECATION: TileSource data lifecycle handlers: system manages these automatically: TileSource.[createTileCache|destroyTileCache|getTileCacheData|getTileCacheDataAsImage|getTileCacheDataAsContext2D]
    * Tiles data is driven by caches: tiles can have multiple caches and cache can reference multiple tiles.
    * Data types & conversion pipeline: caches support automated conversion between types, and call optionally destructors. These are asynchronous.
    * Data conversion reasoning: the system keeps costs of convertors and seeks the cheapest conversion to a target format (using Dijkstra).
    * Async support: events can now await handlers. Added OpenSeadragon.Promise proxy object. This object supports also synchronous mode.
    * Drawers define what data they are able to work with, and receive automatically data from one of the declared types.
    * Drawers now store data only inside cache, and provide optional type convertors to move data into a format they can work with.
    * TileSource equality operator. TileSource destructor support. TileSources now must output type of the data they download [context.finish].
    * Zombies: data can outlive tiles, and be kept in the system to wait if they are not suddenly needed. Turned on automatically with TiledImage addition with `replace: true` and equality test success.
    * ImagesLoadedPerFrame is boosted 10 times when system is fresh (reset / open) and then declines back to original value.
    * CacheRecord supports 'internal cache' of 'SimpleCache' type. This cache can be used by drawers to hide complex types used for rendering. Such caches are stored internally on CacheRecord objects.
    * CacheRecord drives asynchronous data management and ensures correct behavior through awaiting Promises.
    * TileCache adds new methods for cache modification: renameCache, cloneCache, injectCache, replaceCache, restoreTilesThatShareOriginalCache, safeUnloadCache, unloadCacheForTile and more. Used internally within invalidation events
    * Tiles have up to two 'originalCacheKey' and 'cacheKey' caches, which keep original data and target drawn data (if modified).
    * Invalidation Pipeline: New event 'tile-invalidated' and requestInvalidate methods on World and TiledImage. Tiles get methods to modify data to draw, system prepares data for drawing and swaps them with the current main tile cache.
    * New test suites for the new cache system, conversion pipeline and invalidation events.
    * New testing/demo utilities (MockSeadragon, DrawerSwitcher for switching drawers in demos, getBuiltInDrawersForTest for testing all drawers), serialization guard in tests to remove circular references.
    * New demos, demonstrating the new pipeline. New demos for older plugins to show how compatible new version is.
    * Misc: updated CSS for dev server, new dev & test commands.
* New tile source: IIP (Internet Imaging Protocol) (#2719 @ruven)
* New option: loadDestinationTilesOnAnimation. With it on, during animations, OSD loads tiles in the destination region, rather than the areas passed through on the way to the destination. This new feature is on by default. (#2686, #2690 @MichaelWGibson)
* Overlay wrapper elements now have a "openseadragon-overlay-wrapper" class. If the overlay element has an ID, the wrapper gets a variant on that ID, but if the overlay element does not have an ID, we no longer give the wrapper an ID. (#2698 @lokaesshwar)
* The functions the viewer uses to operate the zoom in and zoom out buttons are now accessible to be called programatically (#2702 @achu1998)
* The Viewer now has a getFullyLoaded function and a fully-loaded-change event, so you can know when all of the images in the viewer are loaded (#2707 @achu1998)
* The Viewer and TiledImage now both have a whenFullyLoaded function that will call you back when they are fully loaded (#2707 @achu1998)
* Improved IIIF tile requests in certain edge cases (#2710 @ruven)
* Now only removing OSD-created elements on destroy (rather than emptying out the entire container) (#2724 @Vinith1919)

    * The new eventSource property in the event object replaces the old eventSource parameter that was passed to handler methods.
    * Where the event object duplicated the eventSource value, those properties have been removed. This affects the following events:
        * All Button events - 'button' property removed
        * All Viewer (Viewer, Drawer, Viewport) events - 'viewer' property removed
* BREAKING CHANGE: Renamed EventHandler to EventSource (#225)
* BREAKING CHANGE: Event names changed for consistency: changed to lower case, compound names hyphenated, and "on" prefixes removed (#226):
    * Viewer "animationstart" changed to "animation-start"
    * Viewer "animationfinish" changed to "animation-finish"
    * Button "onPress" changed to "press"
    * Button "onRelease" changed to "release"
    * Button "onClick" changed to "click"

    * Retains scroll position when switching back out.
    * More resilient to styling variations on the page.
    * setFullPage no longer automatically engages fullScreen; there's now a separate setFullScreen.
    * 'fullpage' event is now 'full-page'.
    * The `fullpage` property of the 'full-page' event is now `fullPage`.
    * There is now a 'full-screen' event with a `fullScreen` property (true if it has gone to full screen).
    * There are now 'pre-full-page' and 'pre-full-screen' events that include a `preventDefaultAction` property you can set in your handler to cancel. They also have `fullPage` and `fullScreen` properties respectively, to indicate if they are going into or out of the mode.
* BREAKING CHANGE: Removed the 'onPageChange' callback from the viewer options. Viewer.goToPage() now raises the 'page' event only (#285)

* Added a boolean preventDefaultAction property (default false) to the event object passed to MouseTracker handler methods. (#270) Implemented in the following MouseTracker subscribers:
    * Viewer.keyboardCommandArea.innerTracker.focusHandler: preventDefaultAction == true prevents scrolling viewer into view
