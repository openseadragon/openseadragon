1.0.0:

NOTE: This version has a number of breaking changes to the API, mostly in event handling. See below.

* BREAKING CHANGE: All EventSource and MouseTracker event handler method signatures changed to 'handlerMethod(event)' where event == { eventSource, userData, ... } (#251) (Also fixes #23, #224, #239)
    * The new eventSource property in the event object replaces the old eventSource parameter that was passed to handler methods.
    * Where the event object duplicated the eventSource value, those properties have been removed. This affects the following events:
        * All Button events - 'button' property removed
        * All Viewer (Viewer, Drawer, Viewport) events - 'viewer' property removed
* BREAKING CHANGE: Renamed EventHandler to EventSource (#225)
* BREAKING CHANGE: Event names changed for consistency: changed to lower case, compound names hyphenated, and "on" prefixes removed (#226):
    * Viewer "animationstart" changed to "animation-start"
    * Viewer "animationfinish" changed to "animation-finish"
    * Button "onPress" changed to "press"
    * Button "onRelease" changed to "release"
    * Button "onClick" changed to "click"
    * Button "onEnter" changed to "enter"
    * Button "onExit" changed to "exit"
    * Button "onFocus" changed to "focus"
    * Button "onBlur" changed to "blur"
* BREAKING CHANGE: Numerous improvements to fullPage/fullScreen (#256):
    * Retains zoom/pan position better when switching into and out of fullPage.
    * Retains scroll position when switching back out.
    * More resilient to styling variations on the page.
    * setFullPage no longer automatically engages fullScreen; there's now a separate setFullScreen.
    * 'fullpage' event is now 'full-page'.
    * The `fullpage` property of the 'full-page' event is now `fullPage`.
    * There is now a 'full-screen' event with a `fullScreen` property (true if it has gone to full screen).
    * There are now 'pre-full-page' and 'pre-full-screen' events that include a `preventDefaultAction` property you can set in your handler to cancel. They also have `fullPage` and `fullScreen` properties respectively, to indicate if they are going into or out of the mode.
* BREAKING CHANGE: Removed the 'onPageChange' callback from the viewer options. Viewer.goToPage() now raises the 'page' event only (#285)
* Major documentation improvements (#281)
* MouseTracker now passes the original event objects to its handler methods (#23)
* MouseTracker now supports an optional 'moveHandler' method for tracking mousemove events (#215)

* Added the ability to create a viewer and start at a specified page (#252)
* Fixed image resolve issue with collection mode (#255)
* DOM events are now passed through as 'event.originalEvent' in viewer and button events where appropriate. (#257) Affects the following events:
    * Viewer: 'canvas-release', 'canvas-click', 'canvas-drag', 'canvas-scroll', 'container-enter', 'container-exit', 'container-release'
    * Button: 'enter', 'exit', 'press', 'release', 'focus', 'blur', 'click'
* Fixed: IE 10 not reading DZI file correctly in certain circumstances (#218)
* Added support for the 'wheel' DOM mousewheel event (#261)
* Fix for non-canvas tile rendering at large size (#264)
* Drawer now uses an HTML5 canvas element whenever it's available. Can be overridden with the Viewer.useCanvas option (#191)
* Added a boolean preventDefaultAction property (default false) to the event object passed to MouseTracker handler methods. (#270) Implemented in the following MouseTracker subscribers:
    * Viewer.keyboardCommandArea.innerTracker.focusHandler: preventDefaultAction == true prevents scrolling viewer into view
