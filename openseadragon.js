 * OpenSeadragon - Javascript Deep Zooming
 * </strong>
 * </h2> 
 * <p>
 * OpenSeadragon is provides an html interface for creating 
 * deep zoom user interfaces.  The simplest examples include deep 
 * zoom for large resolution images, and complex examples include
 * zoomable map interfaces driven by SVG files.

 /** 
  * The root namespace for OpenSeadragon, this function also serves as a single
  * point of instantiation for an {@link OpenSeadragon.Viewer}, including all 
  * combinations of out-of-the-box configurable features.  All utility methods 
  * and classes are defined on or below this namespace. 
  *
  * @namespace
  * @function
  * @name OpenSeadragon
  * @exports $ as OpenSeadragon
  *
  * @param {Object} options All required and optional settings for instantiating
  *     a new instance of an OpenSeadragon image viewer. 
  *
  * @param {String} options.xmlPath 
  *     DEPRECATED. A relative path to load a DZI file from the server. 
  *     Prefer the newer options.tileSources.
  *
  * @param {Array|String|Function|Object[]|Array[]|String[]|Function[]} options.tileSources
  *     As an Array, the tileSource can hold either be all Objects or mixed 
  *     types of Arrays of Objects, String, Function. When a value is a String, 
  *     the tileSource is used to create a {@link OpenSeadragon.DziTileSource}.  
  *     When a value is a Function, the function is used to create a new 
  *     {@link OpenSeadragon.TileSource} whose abstract method 
  *     getUrl( level, x, y ) is implemented by the function. Finally, when it 
  *     is an Array of objects, it is used to create a 
  *     {@link OpenSeadragon.LegacyTileSource}.
  *
  * @param {Boolean} [options.debugMode=true]
  *     Currently does nothing. TODO: provide an in-screen panel providing event
  *     detail feedback.
  *
  * @param {Number} [options.animationTime=1.5]
  *     Specifies the animation duration per each {@link OpenSeadragon.Spring}
  *     which occur when the image is dragged or zoomed.
  *
  * @param {Number} [options.blendTime=0.5] 
  *     Specifies the duration of animation as higher or lower level tiles are
  *     replacing the existing tile.
  *
  * @param {Boolean} [options.alwaysBlend=false]
  *     Forces the tile to always blend.  By default the tiles skip blending
  *     when the blendTime is surpassed and the current animation frame would
  *     not complete the blend.
  *
  * @param {Boolean} [options.autoHideControls=true]
  *     If the user stops interacting with the viewport, fade the navigation 
  *     controls.  Useful for presentation since the controls are by default
  *     floated on top of the image the user is viewing.
  *
  * @param {Boolean} [options.immediateRender=false]
  *     Render the best closest level first, ignoring the lowering levels which
  *     provide the effect of very blurry to sharp. It is recommended to change 
  *     setting to true for mobile devices.
  *
  * @param {Boolean} [options.wrapHorizontal=false]
  *     Set to true to force the image to wrap horizontally within the viewport.
  *     Useful for maps or images representing the surface of a sphere or cylinder.
  *
  * @param {Boolean} [options.wrapVertical=false]
  *     Set to true to force the image to wrap vertically within the viewport.
  *     Useful for maps or images representing the surface of a sphere or cylinder.
  *
  * @param {Number} [options.minZoomImageRatio=0.8]
  *     The minimum percentage ( expressed as a number between 0 and 1 ) of 
  *     the viewport height or width at which the zoom out will be constrained.
  *     Setting it to 0, for example will allow you to zoom out infinitly.
  *
  * @param {Number} [options.maxZoomPixelRatio=2]
  *     The maximum ratio to allow a zoom-in to affect the highest level pixel
  *     ratio. This can be set to Infinity to allow 'infinite' zooming into the
  *     image though it is less effective visually if the HTML5 Canvas is not 
  *     availble on the viewing device.
  *
  * @param {Number} [options.visibilityRatio=0.5]
  *     The percentage ( as a number from 0 to 1 ) of the source image which
  *     must be kept within the viewport.  If the image is dragged beyond that
  *     limit, it will 'bounce' back until the minimum visibility ration is 
  *     achieved.  Setting this to 0 and wrapHorizontal ( or wrapVertical ) to
  *     true will provide the effect of an infinitely scrolling viewport.
  *
  * @param {Number} [options.springStiffness=5.0]
  *
  * @param {Number} [options.imageLoaderLimit=0]
  *     The maximum number of image requests to make concurrently.  By default
  *     it is set to 0 allowing the browser to make the maximum number of
  *     image requests in parallel as allowed by the browsers policy.
  *
  * @param {Number} [options.clickTimeThreshold=200]
  *     If multiple mouse clicks occurs within less than this number of 
  *     milliseconds, treat them as a single click.
  *
  * @param {Number} [options.clickDistThreshold=5]
  *     If a mouse or touch drag occurs and the distance to the starting drag
  *     point is less than this many pixels, ignore the drag event.
  *
  * @param {Number} [options.zoomPerClick=2.0]
  *     The "zoom distance" per mouse click or touch tap.
  *
  * @param {Number} [options.zoomPerScroll=1.2]
  *     The "zoom distance" per mouse scroll or touch pinch.
  *
  * @param {Number} [options.zoomPerSecond=2.0]
  *     The number of seconds to animate a single zoom event over.
  *
  * @param {Boolean} [options.showNavigationControl=true]
  *     Set to false to prevent the appearance of the default navigation controls.
  *
  * @param {Number} [options.controlsFadeDelay=2000]
  *     The number of milliseconds to wait once the user has stopped interacting
  *     with the interface before begining to fade the controls. Assumes
  *     showNavigationControl and autoHideControls are both true.
  *
  * @param {Number} [options.controlsFadeLength=1500]
  *     The number of milliseconds to animate the controls fading out.
  *
  * @param {Number} [options.maxImageCacheCount=100]
  *     The max number of images we should keep in memory (per drawer).
  *
  * @param {Number} [options.minPixelRatio=0.5]
  *     The higher the minPixelRatio, the lower the quality of the image that
  *     is considered sufficient to stop rendering a given zoom level.  For
  *     example, if you are targeting mobile devices with less bandwith you may 
  *     try setting this to 1.5 or higher.
  *
  * @param {Boolean} [options.mouseNavEnabled=true]
  *     Is the user able to interact with the image via mouse or touch. Default 
  *     interactions include draging the image in a plane, and zooming in toward
  *     and away from the image.
  *
  * @param {Boolean} [options.preserveViewport=false]
  *     If the viewer has been configured with a sequence of tile sources, then
  *     normally navigating to through each image resets the viewport to 'home'
  *     position.  If preserveViewport is set to true, then the viewport position
  *     is preserved when navigating between images in the sequence.
  *
  * @param {String} [options.prefixUrl='']
  *     Appends the prefixUrl to navImages paths, which is very useful
  *     since the default paths are rarely useful for production
  *     environments.
  *
  * @param {Object} [options.navImages=]
  *     An object with a property for each button or other built-in navigation
  *     control, eg the current 'zoomIn', 'zoomOut', 'home', and 'fullpage'.
  *     Each of those in turn provides an image path for each state of the botton
  *     or navigation control, eg 'REST', 'GROUP', 'HOVER', 'PRESS'. Finally the
  *     image paths, by default assume there is a folder on the servers root path
  *     called '/images', eg '/images/zoomin_rest.png'.  If you need to adjust
  *     these paths, prefer setting the option.prefixUrl rather than overriding 
  *     every image path directly through this setting.
