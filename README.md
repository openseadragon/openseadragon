# OpenSeadragon 

An open-source, web-based viewer for zoomable images, implemented in pure JavaScript.

See it in action and get started using it at http://openseadragon.github.io/.

## Stable Builds

See the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/openseadragon/openseadragon/releases).

## Development

If you want to use OpenSeadragon in your own projects, you can find the latest stable build, API documentation, and example code at http://openseadragon.github.io/. If you want to modify OpenSeadragon and/or contribute to its development, read on.

### First Time Setup

All command-line operations for building and testing OpenSeadragon are scripted using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) which is based on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/). To get set up:

1. Install Node, if you haven't already (available at the link above)
1. Install the Grunt command line runner (if you haven't already); on the command line, run `npm install -g grunt-cli`
1. Clone the openseadragon repository
1. On the command line, go in to the openseadragon folder
1. Run `npm install`

You're set... continue reading for build and test instructions.

### Building from Source

To build, just run (on the command line, in the openseadragon folder):

    grunt

If you want Grunt to watch your source files and rebuild every time you change one, use:

    grunt watch

The built files appear in the `build` folder.

If you want to build tar and zip files for distribution (they will also appear in the `build` folder), use:

    grunt package

Note that the `build` folder is masked with .gitignore; it's just for your local use, and won't be checked in to the repository.

You can also publish the built version to the site-build repository. This assumes you have cloned it next to this repository. The command is:

    grunt publish

... which will delete the existing openseadragon folder, along with the .zip and .tar.gz files, out of the site-build folder and replace them with newly built ones from the source in this repository; you'll then need to commit the changes to site-build.

### Testing

Our tests are based on [QUnit](http://qunitjs.com/) and [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/); they're both installed when you run `npm install`. At the moment we don't have much in the way of tests, but we're working to fix that. To run on the command line:

    grunt test

If you wish to work interactively with the tests or test your changes:

    grunt connect watch

and open `http://localhost:8000/` in your browser
