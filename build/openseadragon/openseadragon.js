 /**
  * All required and optional settings for instantiating a new instance of an OpenSeadragon image viewer.
  *
  * @typedef {Object} Options
  * @memberof OpenSeadragon
  *
  * @property {String} id
  *     Id of the element to append the viewer's container element to. If not provided, the 'element' property must be provided.
  *     If both the element and id properties are specified, the viewer is appended to the element provided in the element property.
  *
  * @property {Element} element
  *     The element to append the viewer's container element to. If not provided, the 'id' property must be provided.
  *     If both the element and id properties are specified, the viewer is appended to the element provided in the element property.
  *
  * @property {Array|String|Function|Object} [tileSources=null]
  *     Tile source(s) to open initially. This is a complex parameter; see
  *     {@link OpenSeadragon.Viewer#open} for details.
  *
  * @property {Number} [tabIndex=0]
  *     Tabbing order index to assign to the viewer element. Positive values are selected in increasing order. When tabIndex is 0
  *     source order is used. A negative value omits the viewer from the tabbing order.
  *
  * @property {Array} overlays Array of objects defining permanent overlays of
  *     the viewer. The overlays added via this option and later removed with
  *     {@link OpenSeadragon.Viewer#removeOverlay} will be added back when a new
  *     image is opened.
  *     To add overlays which can be definitively removed, one must use
  *     {@link OpenSeadragon.Viewer#addOverlay}
  *     If displaying a sequence of images, the overlays can be associated
  *     with a specific page by passing the overlays array to the page's
  *     tile source configuration.
  *     Expected properties:
  *     * x, y, (or px, py for pixel coordinates) to define the location.
  *     * width, height in point if using x,y or in pixels if using px,py. If width
  *       and height are specified, the overlay size is adjusted when zooming,
  *       otherwise the size stays the size of the content (or the size defined by CSS).
  *     * className to associate a class to the overlay
  *     * id to set the overlay element. If an element with this id already exists,
  *       it is reused, otherwise it is created. If not specified, a new element is
  *       created.
  *     * placement a string to define the relative position to the viewport.
  *       Only used if no width and height are specified. Default: 'TOP_LEFT'.
  *       See {@link OpenSeadragon.Placement} for possible values.
  *
  * @property {String} [xmlPath=null]
  *     <strong>DEPRECATED</strong>. A relative path to load a DZI file from the server.
  *     Prefer the newer Options.tileSources.
  *
  * @property {String} [prefixUrl='/images/']
  *     Prepends the prefixUrl to navImages paths, which is very useful
  *     since the default paths are rarely useful for production
  *     environments.
  *
  * @property {OpenSeadragon.NavImages} [navImages]
  *     An object with a property for each button or other built-in navigation
  *     control, eg the current 'zoomIn', 'zoomOut', 'home', and 'fullpage'.
  *     Each of those in turn provides an image path for each state of the button
  *     or navigation control, eg 'REST', 'GROUP', 'HOVER', 'PRESS'. Finally the
  *     image paths, by default assume there is a folder on the servers root path
  *     called '/images', eg '/images/zoomin_rest.png'.  If you need to adjust
  *     these paths, prefer setting the option.prefixUrl rather than overriding
  *     every image path directly through this setting.
  *
  * @property {Boolean} [debugMode=false]
  *     TODO: provide an in-screen panel providing event detail feedback.
  *
  * @property {String} [debugGridColor=['#437AB2', '#1B9E77', '#D95F02', '#7570B3', '#E7298A', '#66A61E', '#E6AB02', '#A6761D', '#666666']]
  *     The colors of grids in debug mode. Each tiled image's grid uses a consecutive color.
  *     If there are more tiled images than provided colors, the color vector is recycled.
  *
  * @property {Number} [blendTime=0]
  *     Specifies the duration of animation as higher or lower level tiles are
  *     replacing the existing tile.
  *
  * @property {Boolean} [alwaysBlend=false]
  *     Forces the tile to always blend.  By default the tiles skip blending
  *     when the blendTime is surpassed and the current animation frame would
  *     not complete the blend.
  *
  * @property {Boolean} [autoHideControls=true]
  *     If the user stops interacting with the viewport, fade the navigation
  *     controls.  Useful for presentation since the controls are by default
  *     floated on top of the image the user is viewing.
  *
  * @property {Boolean} [immediateRender=false]
  *     Render the best closest level first, ignoring the lowering levels which
  *     provide the effect of very blurry to sharp. It is recommended to change
  *     setting to true for mobile devices.
  *
  * @property {Number} [defaultZoomLevel=0]
  *     Zoom level to use when image is first opened or the home button is clicked.
  *     If 0, adjusts to fit viewer.
  *
  * @property {Number} [opacity=1]
  *     Default proportional opacity of the tiled images (1=opaque, 0=hidden)
  *     Hidden images do not draw and only load when preloading is allowed.
  *
  * @property {Boolean} [preload=false]
  *     Default switch for loading hidden images (true loads, false blocks)
  *
  * @property {String} [compositeOperation=null]
  *     Valid values are 'source-over', 'source-atop', 'source-in', 'source-out',
  *     'destination-over', 'destination-atop', 'destination-in',
  *     'destination-out', 'lighter', 'copy' or 'xor'
  *
  * @property {Boolean} [imageSmoothingEnabled=true]
  *     Image smoothing for canvas rendering (only if canvas is used). Note: Ignored
  *     by some (especially older) browsers which do not support this canvas property.
  *     This property can be changed in {@link Viewer.Drawer.setImageSmoothingEnabled}.
  *
  * @property {String|CanvasGradient|CanvasPattern|Function} [placeholderFillStyle=null]
  *     Draws a colored rectangle behind the tile if it is not loaded yet.
  *     You can pass a CSS color value like "#FF8800".
  *     When passing a function the tiledImage and canvas context are available as argument which is useful when you draw a gradient or pattern.
  *
  * @property {Number} [degrees=0]
  *     Initial rotation.
  *
  * @property {Boolean} [flipped=false]
  *     Initial flip state.
  *
  * @property {Number} [minZoomLevel=null]
  *
  * @property {Number} [maxZoomLevel=null]
  *
  * @property {Boolean} [homeFillsViewer=false]
  *     Make the 'home' button fill the viewer and clip the image, instead
  *     of fitting the image to the viewer and letterboxing.
  *
  * @property {Boolean} [panHorizontal=true]
  *     Allow horizontal pan.
  *
  * @property {Boolean} [panVertical=true]
  *     Allow vertical pan.
  *
  * @property {Boolean} [constrainDuringPan=false]
  *
  * @property {Boolean} [wrapHorizontal=false]
  *     Set to true to force the image to wrap horizontally within the viewport.
  *     Useful for maps or images representing the surface of a sphere or cylinder.
  *
  * @property {Boolean} [wrapVertical=false]
  *     Set to true to force the image to wrap vertically within the viewport.
  *     Useful for maps or images representing the surface of a sphere or cylinder.
  *
  * @property {Number} [minZoomImageRatio=0.9]
  *     The minimum percentage ( expressed as a number between 0 and 1 ) of
  *     the viewport height or width at which the zoom out will be constrained.
  *     Setting it to 0, for example will allow you to zoom out infinity.
  *
  * @property {Number} [maxZoomPixelRatio=1.1]
  *     The maximum ratio to allow a zoom-in to affect the highest level pixel
  *     ratio. This can be set to Infinity to allow 'infinite' zooming into the
  *     image though it is less effective visually if the HTML5 Canvas is not
  *     available on the viewing device.
  *
  * @property {Number} [smoothTileEdgesMinZoom=1.1]
  *     A zoom percentage ( where 1 is 100% ) of the highest resolution level.
  *     When zoomed in beyond this value alternative compositing will be used to
  *     smooth out the edges between tiles. This will have a performance impact.
  *     Can be set to Infinity to turn it off.
  *     Note: This setting is ignored on iOS devices due to a known bug (See {@link https://github.com/openseadragon/openseadragon/issues/952})
  *
  * @property {Boolean} [iOSDevice=?]
  *     True if running on an iOS device, false otherwise.
  *     Used to disable certain features that behave differently on iOS devices.
  *
  * @property {Boolean} [autoResize=true]
  *     Set to false to prevent polling for viewer size changes. Useful for providing custom resize behavior.
  *
  * @property {Number} [autoResizeInterval=5000]
  *     How often polling for viewer size should occur. This requires autoResize=true (default).
  *
  * @property {Boolean} [preserveImageSizeOnResize=false]
  *     Set to true to have the image size preserved when the viewer is resized. This requires autoResize=true (default).
  *
  * @property {Number} [minScrollDeltaTime=50]
  *     Number of milliseconds between canvas-scroll events. This value helps normalize the rate of canvas-scroll
  *     events between different devices, causing the faster devices to slow down enough to make the zoom control
  *     more manageable.
  *
  * @property {Number} [rotationIncrement=90]
  *     The number of degrees to rotate right or left when the rotate buttons or keyboard shortcuts are activated.
  *
  * @property {Number} [pixelsPerWheelLine=40]
  *     For pixel-resolution scrolling devices, the number of pixels equal to one scroll line.
  *
  * @property {Number} [pixelsPerArrowPress=40]
  *     The number of pixels viewport moves when an arrow key is pressed.
  *
  * @property {Number} [visibilityRatio=0.5]
  *     The percentage ( as a number from 0 to 1 ) of the source image which
  *     must be kept within the viewport.  If the image is dragged beyond that
  *     limit, it will 'bounce' back until the minimum visibility ratio is
  *     achieved.  Setting this to 0 and wrapHorizontal ( or wrapVertical ) to
  *     true will provide the effect of an infinitely scrolling viewport.
  *
  * @property {Object} [viewportMargins={}]
  *     Pushes the "home" region in from the sides by the specified amounts.
  *     Possible subproperties (Numbers, in screen coordinates): left, top, right, bottom.
  *
  * @property {Number} [imageLoaderLimit=0]
  *     The maximum number of image requests to make concurrently. By default
  *     it is set to 0 allowing the browser to make the maximum number of
  *     image requests in parallel as allowed by the browsers policy.
  *
  * @property {Number} [clickTimeThreshold=300]
  *      The number of milliseconds within which a pointer down-up event combination
  *      will be treated as a click gesture.
  *
  * @property {Number} [clickDistThreshold=5]
  *      The maximum distance allowed between a pointer down event and a pointer up event
  *      to be treated as a click gesture.
  *
  * @property {Number} [dblClickTimeThreshold=300]
  *      The number of milliseconds within which two pointer down-up event combinations
  *      will be treated as a double-click gesture.
  *
  * @property {Number} [dblClickDistThreshold=20]
  *      The maximum distance allowed between two pointer click events
  *      to be treated as a double-click gesture.
  *
  * @property {Number} [springStiffness=6.5]
  *
  * @property {Number} [animationTime=1.2]
  *     Specifies the animation duration per each {@link OpenSeadragon.Spring}
  *     which occur when the image is dragged or zoomed.
  *
  * @property {OpenSeadragon.GestureSettings} [gestureSettingsMouse]
  *     Settings for gestures generated by a mouse pointer device. (See {@link OpenSeadragon.GestureSettings})

  *     If specified, navigatorSizeRatio and navigatorMaintainSizeRatio are ignored.
  *
  * @property {Boolean} [navigatorAutoResize=true]
  *     Set to false to prevent polling for navigator size changes. Useful for providing custom resize behavior.
  *     Setting to false can also improve performance when the navigator is configured to a fixed size.
  *
  * @property {Boolean} [navigatorAutoFade=true]
  *     If the user stops interacting with the viewport, fade the navigator minimap.
  *     Setting to false will make the navigator minimap always visible.

  * @property {Boolean} [useCanvas=true]
  *     Set to false to not use an HTML canvas element for image rendering even if canvas is supported.
  *
  * @property {Number} [minPixelRatio=0.5]
  *     The higher the minPixelRatio, the lower the quality of the image that
  *     is considered sufficient to stop rendering a given zoom level.  For
  *     example, if you are targeting mobile devices with less bandwidth you may
  *     try setting this to 1.5 or higher.
  *
  * @property {Boolean} [mouseNavEnabled=true]
  *     Is the user able to interact with the image via mouse or touch. Default
  *     interactions include draging the image in a plane, and zooming in toward

     * A description of the format can be found here:
     * https://ecommons.cornell.edu/bitstream/handle/1813/5410/Introducing_Zoomify_Image.pdf
     *
     * There are two ways of creating a zoomify tilesource for openseadragon
     *
     * 1) Supplying all necessary information in the tilesource object. A minimal example object for this method looks like this:
     *
     * {
     *      type: "zoomifytileservice",
     *      width: 1000,
     *      height: 1000,
     *      tilesUrl: "/test/data/zoomify/"
     * }
     *
     * The tileSize is set to 256 (the usual Zoomify default) when it is not defined. The tileUrl must the path to the image _directory_.
     *
     * 2) Loading image metadata from xml file: (CURRENTLY NOT SUPPORTED)
     *
     * When creating zoomify formatted images one "xml" like file with name ImageProperties.xml
     * will be created as well. Here is an example of such a file:
     *
     * <IMAGE_PROPERTIES WIDTH="1000" HEIGHT="1000" NUMTILES="21" NUMIMAGES="1" VERSION="1.8" TILESIZE="256" />
     *
     * To use this xml file as metadata source you must supply the path to the ImageProperties.xml file and leave out all other parameters:
     * As stated above, this method of loading a zoomify tilesource is currently not supported
     *
     * {
     *      type: "zoomifytileservice",
     *      tilesUrl: "/test/data/zoomify/ImageProperties.xml"

 *  The CollectionDrawer is a reimplementation if the Drawer API that
 *  focuses on allowing a viewport to be redefined as a collection
 *  of smaller viewports, defined by a clear number of rows and / or
 *  columns of which each item in the matrix of viewports has its own
 *  source.
 *
 *  This idea is a reexpression of the idea of dzi collections
 *  which allows a clearer algorithm to reuse the tile sources already
 *  supported by OpenSeadragon, in heterogenious or homogenious
 *  sequences just like mixed groups already supported by the viewer
 *  for the purpose of image sequnces.
 *
 *  TODO:   The difficult part of this feature is figuring out how to express
 *          this functionality as a combination of the functionality already
 *          provided by Drawer, Viewport, TileSource, and Navigator.  It may
 *          require better abstraction at those points in order to efficiently
 *          reuse those paradigms.
